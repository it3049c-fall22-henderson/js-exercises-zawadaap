## Self-Reflection:
I learned and reviewed a lot about writting functions and using properties in Javascript. I did get stuck on a few tests and for the most part, was able to figure out the problems. I struggled a lot on test #4 and decided to leave it blank. Also forgot to commit changes until I was finished oops.
